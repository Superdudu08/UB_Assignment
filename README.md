## Notes

I was not able to go that far with the assignment. 
It made me realize I have struggles with the configuration part, which is frustrating because it took most of my time today and it prevented me to go further and show you what I can do. But it's also a part of the skills I should have, and it gives me a clear idea on what I can improve on.
